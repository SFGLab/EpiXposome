# üåê Team7_EpiXposome
## üß¨ Epigenomics_Harmonization_Exposome

## üîç Key Features

EpiXposome aims to decode the impact of environmental exposures on epigenetic changes using advanced machine learning. Our goal is to predict disease risks by revealing how exposome variables interact with epigenetic markers. This project promises to deliver actionable insights that could revolutionize disease prevention and treatment.

## Steps

1. **Step 1: Data Collection**
   - Data Sources:
     - miRNA expression data from CPTAC2 and TARGET
     - DNA methylation data from TCGA, ENCODE, TARGET, and TCGA
     - Exposome data from NOAA Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)

2. **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and impute missing data for robust analysis.
   - Prepare the data by addressing any quality control issues.
  
3. **Step 3: Dimensionality Reduction and Data Integration**
   - Use PCA to reduce dimensions down to three.
   - Use Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to integrate disparate data sets and find underlying relationships.

4. **Step 4: Data Splitting**
   - Randomly split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

5. **Step 5: Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BiRNNs)**
   - Run Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BiRNNs) model to determine dependencies between exposome variables,
     methylation and microRNA data sets.

6. **Step 6: Model Training**
   - Train the selected machine learning model using the training dataset.

7. **Step 7: Model Testing**
   - Assess the model's performance using the testing dataset to validate its accuracy.

8. **Step 8: Experimentation**
   - Investigate the effects of different exposome variables on mRNA and methylation activity.
   - Determine if there are specific genes or pathways involved.

9. **Step 9: Results Interpretation**
   - Use bioinformatics analyses (like GSEA, GO) to interpret the model's findings.

10. **Step 10: Visualization**
   - Develop visualizations to represent the results clearly (e.g., time-altered line plots).
